Every frame looked handcrafted, like the director dipped their fingers into the screen and rearranged reality just for fun. The acting? Bro… unreal. The lead carried this quiet storm energy that made every tiny expression hit like a prophecy. Even when nobody was talking, the silence felt alive, slithering around the edges like it knew secrets it refused to share. The score wrapped around the story like a heartbeat—steady, comforting, but always a little off-kilter, reminding you something bigger was coming. And when the emotional punch finally landed in the final act? I swear my soul did a somersault. It’s the kind of film that follows you home, sits in your room, and whispers, “think about me.” And I do. I will. Forever. 10/10, honestly felt like being gently haunted by beauty.\"\n",

Every scene dragged itself across the floor, begging to matter, but never getting there. The dialogue felt like someone fed an AI a motivational poster and said “make it deep.” Characters wandered around like NPCs who forgot their quest lines. Nothing they said or did connected to anything. The story kept hinting at meaning, but every reveal landed flatter than a broken jump scare. I swear the plot twists were so predictable I called one while half-asleep scrolling my phone. The soundtrack was dramatic for no reason—violins screaming while someone boiled pasta or stared at a lamp like it held the secrets of the universe. Bro, I was fighting for my life trying not to laugh. By the end, I felt like the movie siphoned my energy, my patience, and maybe part of my lifespan. 2/10, only because the credits rolled and freed me.\"\n",
